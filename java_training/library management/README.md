# Spring Boot Application

This is a sample Java / Maven / Spring Boot application. It can be used as a starter project. Currently it is designed to work as Library Magagement service.

## Installation Instructions
  You can import the project as a maven application to your favorite IDE. I made my tests by using eclipse jee-2024-03.
  
## To run the application
Use one of the several ways of running a Spring Boot application. Below are just three options:

1. Build using maven goal (or by using maven wrapper): `mvn clean package` and execute the resulting artifact as follows `java -jar LibraryManagementSystem-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` or
2. Right click on Project/ Main method class and run as Java Application.
